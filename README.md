# Hybrid-Search

## Overview
In this project, we'll create a hybrid search system using Pinecone to combine sparse and dense vectors for a more comprehensive search. We'll use a fashion product dataset, encode the product names using BM25 for sparse vectors, and SentenceTransformers for dense vectors.
